# volts-laboratory

A collection of configuration and shader files for the [monkey-hi-hat](https://github.com/MV10/monkey-hi-hat) music visualization program. Refer to the README in that repository for more information.

For the time being (since the project is new), most of these are either utilitarian demos for the audio textures generated by the underlying [eyecandy](https://github.com/MV10/eyecandy) library, or adaptations from [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) or [VertexShaderArt](https://www.vertexshaderart.com/). Links to the original are available in comments of each `.conf` file.

I don't see much point in actually sharing playlists, they're easy to create and "favorites" will be highly subjective, but [`demo_playlist.conf`](playlists/demo_playlist.conf) is here as a reference for playlist configuration and all supported settings and options. The others are here simply as offsite safekeeping.

> Warning: I don't guarantee that all of these shaders work correctly, and there is at least one which, at the moment, seems to actually crash the driver on one of our PCs. Like playlists, this is first and foremost an offset storage repository for my personal content. Use at your own risk.

Why "Volt's Laboratory"? The name "monkey-hi-hat" was related to my wife's D&D character's familiar, which is a winged monkey-like thing named Volt. As the saying goes, "Naming things is hard."
