# volts-laboratory

A collection of configuration and shader files for the [monkey-hi-hat](https://github.com/MV10/monkey-hi-hat) music visualization program. Refer to the README in that repository for more information.

> YES: I am interested in PRs for new shaders!

For the time being (since the project is new), most of these are either utilitarian demos for the audio textures generated by the underlying [eyecandy](https://github.com/MV10/eyecandy) library, or adaptations from [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) or [VertexShaderArt](https://www.vertexshaderart.com/). Links to the original are available in the comments at the start of each `.conf` file (when applicable).

> Warning: I don't guarantee that all of these shaders work correctly, There is at least one (`gt3_sleepless`) which, at the moment, seems to actually crash the driver on one of our PCs. Like playlists, this is first and foremost an offsite storage repository for my personal content. _There is no warranty here. Use at your own risk._ By the same token, if you leave `cloud_tunnel` running and your GPU burns your house down, don't come crying to me.

Refer to [`notes.txt`](./notes.txt) to see where each came from and what I think about the status of each, and in some cases there may be additional details in the notes in the `.conf` files. But despite those warnings, the MHH program and these shaders _do_ seem to work quite well. I've left this running with all the interesting (non-demo, non-utilitiarn) shaders running for 10+ hours while streaming Spotify.

Note that _some_ of these are not audio-responsive. They either just look cool, or I wanted to convert them to MHH with the hopes that I will add audio support some day.

I don't see much point in actually sharing playlists, they're easy to create and "favorites" will be highly subjective, but [`demo_playlist.conf`](playlists/demo_playlist.conf) is here as a reference for playlist configuration and all supported settings and options. The others are here simply as offsite safekeeping.

Why "Volt's Laboratory"? The name "monkey-hi-hat" was related to my wife's D&D character's familiar, which is a winged monkey-like thing named Volt. As the saying goes, "Naming things is hard."
