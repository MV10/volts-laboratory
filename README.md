# Volt's Laboratory

A collection of visualizations and FX files for the [Monkey Hi Hat](https://github.com/MV10/monkey-hi-hat) music visualization program. Refer to the README in that repository for more information.

## Compatibility
Unless you build your own copy of Monkey Hi Hat from the source repo, you should use the collection zipped in the Monkey Hi Hat "Releases" section. The latest files in this repository often reflect program features and changes that have not yet been released.

## Contributions

> YES: I am interested in PRs for new visualizations and FX!

Since the project is still new and under active new-feature development, most of these are adaptations from [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) or [VertexShaderArt](https://www.vertexshaderart.com/). Attribution links to the originals are available in the comments at the start of each `.conf` file (when applicable). I have tried to avoid any content which explicitly states usage-restrictions or restrictive copyright terms, but if you see any content here which you own, or which you know is not openly available for this type of adapation, please open an issue and I will review (and thanks in advance).

I don't see much point in actually sharing playlists, they're easy to create and "favorites" will be highly subjective, but [`demo_playlist.conf`](playlists/demo_playlist.conf) is here as a reference for playlist configuration and all supported settings and options. The others are here simply as offsite safekeeping.

## Content

Refer to [`notes.txt`](./notes.txt) to see where each came from and what I think about the status of each, and in some cases there may be additional details in the notes in the `.conf` files. But despite those warnings, the MHH program and these shaders _do_ seem to work quite well. I've left this running with all the interesting (non-demo, non-utilitiarn) shaders running for 10+ hours while streaming Spotify.

Note that _some_ of these are not audio-responsive. They either just look cool, or (more likely) I hope to  add audio support some day.

> Warning: I don't guarantee that all of these shaders work correctly. Like playlists, this is first and foremost an offsite storage repository for my personal content. _There is no warranty here. Use at your own risk._ By the same token, if you leave `cloud_tunnel` running at 4K resolution and your GPU burns your house down, don't come crying to me.

## Simian Influences

Why "Volt's Laboratory"? The name "Monkey Hi Hat" was related to my wife's D&D character's familiar, which is a winged monkey-like thing named Volt. We sometimes amuse ourselves by imagining this little guy tap-tap-tapping on hi-hat cymbals in time with the music. As the saying goes, "Naming things is hard."
